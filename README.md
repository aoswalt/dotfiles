# Shell Configs

## Description

My miscellaneous dotfiles for setting up my shell.

Files are setup by creating symlinks pointing to files in the repo to allow for
easy updating, prompting for overwriting.

Some applications can be installed automatically.

## Setup

Run `install.sh` to see a list of the option flags available.
